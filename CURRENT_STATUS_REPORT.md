# Railway Deployment - Current Status Report

**Date**: October 4, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL** (with minor file persistence issue)

---

## 🎉 What's Working

### ✅ All Critical Errors Fixed

1. **Database Initialization** - ✅ WORKING
   - Railway database auto-initializes with base modules
   - No more `KeyError: 'ir.http'` errors
   - Database selector page accessible at `/web/database/selector`

2. **WebSocket Errors** - ✅ FIXED
   - Re-enabled Odoo's evented server (`gevent_port = 8072`)
   - Requests hitting `/websocket` now bind to the dedicated gevent worker
   - No more "Couldn't bind the websocket" runtime errors

3. **Container Stability** - ✅ FIXED
   - Health check optimized (`/web/database/selector`, 90s grace period)
   - Container runs continuously after initialization
   - No unexpected crashes

4. **Railway VOLUME Ban** - ✅ RESOLVED
   - Removed banned `VOLUME` keyword from Dockerfile
   - Documented manual Railway volume setup process

---

## ⚠️ One Remaining Issue: File Persistence

### Problem

Users can **login and use Odoo**, but **uploaded files are lost** between deployments.

**Error in logs:**
```
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 
'/var/lib/odoo/filestore/AATCO/3d/3d7a7360fe4a73a90dd3b4ba554a9254ed61e864'
```

### What This Affects

❌ **Missing files** when accessing AATCO database:
- Company logos don't load
- User avatars show errors (500 status)
- Uploaded documents/attachments missing
- Custom report templates disappear

✅ **Everything else works fine**:
- Database access ✅
- Login functionality ✅
- Data persistence ✅
- Application logic ✅
- Forms and views ✅

### Why This Happens

Railway containers are **ephemeral** - when they restart, any files stored in `/var/lib/odoo/filestore` are lost. 

You need to add a **Railway Volume** to persist files across deployments.

---

## 🔧 How to Fix File Persistence

### Step 1: Add Railway Volume (5 minutes)

**Option A: Railway Dashboard (Recommended)**

1. Go to: https://railway.app
2. Open your **AATCO-CRM-ERP** project
3. Click your service (deployment)
4. Go to **Settings** tab
5. Scroll to **"Volumes"** section
6. Click **"+ New Volume"**
7. Configure:
   - **Mount Path**: `/var/lib/odoo`
   - **Size**: 1GB (or more if you have lots of files)
8. Click **"Add"**
9. Railway will **auto-redeploy** with the volume mounted

**Option B: Railway CLI**

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm i -g @railway/cli

# Login and link to project
railway login
railway link

# Create volume
railway volume create --mount /var/lib/odoo

# Redeploy
railway up
```

### Step 2: Restore Missing Files (Optional)

If you have a backup with the filestore files from AATCO database:

1. **Download your filestore backup** from local Odoo installation:
   - Path: `c:\Program Files\Odoo 17.0.20250930\sessions\filestore\AATCO\`

2. **After Railway volume is added**, upload files via Railway CLI:
   ```bash
   railway run bash
   # Inside container:
   cd /var/lib/odoo/filestore/AATCO/
   # Then use SCP or Railway CLI to upload files
   ```

Or just **re-upload company logos/files** manually through Odoo UI (easier).

## 📊 Deployment Logs Analysis

### What the Logs Tell Us

**Good signs (✅):**
```
[INFO] Database initialization completed successfully.
HTTP service (werkzeug) running on 0.0.0.0:8069
2025-10-04 15:45:46 Login successful for db:AATCO login:yussifronaldo@gmail.com
```

**Minor issues (⚠️):**
```
FileNotFoundError: /var/lib/odoo/filestore/AATCO/3d/3d7a7360...
FileNotFoundError: /var/lib/odoo/filestore/AATCO/a3/a3e869...
FileNotFoundError: /var/lib/odoo/filestore/AATCO/b7/b73a9d...
```

These are **expected without a Railway volume** and will disappear once volume is added.

### Container Stop/Start Behavior

You see `Stopping Container` and `Starting Container` messages:
- **First stop**: After database initialization (`odoo -i base --stop-after-init`) - **NORMAL**
- **Second start**: Regular Odoo server startup - **NORMAL**

This is **working as designed**. The initialization must stop to avoid conflicts.

## 🚀 Current Deployment Status

### Working URLs

- **Railway URL**: `https://aatco-crm-erp-production.up.railway.app`
- **Database Selector**: `/web/database/selector`
- **AATCO Login**: `/web/login?db=AATCO`

### Available Databases

1. **railway** - ✅ Auto-initialized, clean installation
2. **AATCO** - ✅ Working, but missing uploaded files

### User Access

- ✅ **Users can login** to AATCO database
- ✅ **All data is accessible** (customers, orders, etc.)
- ⚠️ **Some UI elements missing** (logos, avatars) due to file storage

## 📋 Post-Deployment Checklist

### Immediate Actions (Required)

- [ ] **Add Railway Volume** for `/var/lib/odoo` (see Step 1 above)
- [ ] **Wait for automatic redeploy** after adding volume
- [ ] **Test file upload** (upload company logo)
- [ ] **Verify logo persists** after Railway redeploy

### Optional Improvements

- [ ] **Re-upload company logos** through Settings > Companies
- [ ] **Re-upload user avatars** through Settings > Users
- [ ] **Restore filestore backup** if you have existing files
- [ ] **Test file attachments** on records
- [ ] **Verify reports with logos** render correctly

### Monitoring

- [ ] **Check Railway logs** for any new errors
- [ ] **Monitor disk usage** of Railway volume
- [ ] **Set up Railway alerts** for service health
- [ ] **Configure backup schedule** for database + filestore

---

## 💡 Performance Optimization (Optional)

Once file persistence is working, consider:

### 1. Database Connection Pooling
Already optimized in `odoo.conf`:
```ini
db_maxconn = 16
workers = 2
```

### 2. Filestore Cleanup
Enable automatic filestore garbage collection:
```bash
# Already configured in odoo.conf
data_dir = /var/lib/odoo
```

### 3. Asset Bundling
Assets are cached automatically by Odoo's `ir.attachment` system.

### 4. CDN for Static Files (Advanced)
If performance becomes an issue, consider:
- Railway CDN for static assets
- Cloudflare proxy in front of Railway
- Separate S3 bucket for large file storage

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If file persistence still doesn't work after adding volume:

1. **Check volume mount path**:
   ```bash
   railway run -- df -h /var/lib/odoo
   ```
   Should show mounted volume, not container filesystem

2. **Check file permissions**:
   ```bash
   railway run -- ls -la /var/lib/odoo/filestore/
   ```
   Should be owned by `odoo` user (or current container user)

3. **Check Odoo config**:
   ```bash
   railway run -- grep "data_dir" /etc/odoo/odoo.conf
   ```
   Should be: `data_dir = /var/lib/odoo`

4. **Clear Odoo cache** after adding volume:
   - Delete database, recreate (or)
   - Restart Railway service
