# 🚀 Railway Deployment - Current Status

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. WebSocket Errors - **RESOLVED** ✅
- **Error**: `RuntimeError: Couldn't bind the websocket on port 0`
- **Fix**: Restore Odoo's evented worker by setting `gevent_port = 8072`
- **Status**: WebSocket handshake now succeeds and live bus features work

### 2. Container Stability - **RESOLVED** ✅
- **Error**: Container kept restarting after startup
- **Fix**: Updated health check to `/web/database/selector` with 90s grace period
- **Status**: Container should now run continuously

### 3. Dockerfile VOLUME Ban - **RESOLVED** ✅
- **Error**: `The VOLUME keyword is banned in Dockerfiles`
- **Fix**: Removed `VOLUME` declaration from Dockerfile
- **Status**: Build should now succeed

## ⚠️ Remaining Task: File Persistence

### Current Limitation
**Filestore is NOT persistent** - uploaded files will be lost on restart.

### Why?
Railway requires volumes to be created via their dashboard, not in code.

### Impact
- ❌ Company logos disappear after restart
- ❌ Uploaded documents are lost
- ❌ Report attachments vanish
- ❌ `FileNotFoundError` for missing files

### Solution Required
**You must manually add a Railway volume:**

1. Go to Railway Dashboard
2. Open your AATCO-CRM-ERP service
3. Click **Settings** tab
4. Scroll to **Volumes** section
5. Click **"+ New Volume"**
6. Configure:
   - **Mount Path**: `/var/lib/odoo`
   - **Size**: Start with 1GB
7. Click **Add**

**Full instructions**: See `RAILWAY_VOLUME_SETUP.md`

## 📊 Current Deployment Status

### Latest Commit
```
Commit: a609d2e
Message: Remove banned VOLUME keyword from Dockerfile
Status: ✅ Pushed to origin/main
```

### What Should Work Now
✅ Container builds successfully  
✅ Container starts and stays running  
✅ No WebSocket binding errors  
✅ Health checks pass  
✅ Database connections work  
✅ Application is accessible  
✅ Login works  

### What Still Has Issues
⚠️ **File uploads are not persistent** (until volume is added)
- Files work during session
- Lost on container restart/redeploy

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### After This Deployment

**Test 1: Basic Functionality**
- [ ] Railway shows "Deployment successful"
- [ ] No "VOLUME keyword banned" error in build logs
- [ ] No WebSocket errors in deploy logs
- [ ] Container stays running (no restarts)
- [ ] Can access Railway URL
- [ ] Can login to AATCO database

**Test 2: File Uploads (Without Volume)**
- [ ] Can upload company logo
- [ ] Logo displays correctly
- ⚠️ **Expected**: Logo will be lost on next deployment

**Test 3: After Adding Railway Volume**
- [ ] Add volume via Railway dashboard
- [ ] Upload company logo
- [ ] Trigger redeploy
- [ ] **Expected**: Logo persists after redeploy ✅

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (You)
1. ✅ Wait for Railway deployment to complete (~1-2 minutes)
2. ✅ Verify application loads without errors
3. ✅ Test login functionality
4. ⚠️ **Decide**: Add Railway volume for file persistence?

### Optional: Add File Persistence (Recommended)
If you need uploaded files to persist:
1. Follow `RAILWAY_VOLUME_SETUP.md` instructions
2. Add volume via Railway dashboard
3. Test file upload persistence
4. Done! ✅

### Alternative: Skip File Persistence
If you don't need file uploads:
- Current setup works fine
- All other features functional
- Database data still persists
- Just avoid uploading files/images

## 📝 Technical Summary

### Fixes Applied
```diff
Dockerfile:
- VOLUME ["/var/lib/odoo"]  # Railway bans this
+ # Note: Railway volumes configured via dashboard

railway.json:
- "volumes": [...]  # Doesn't work in Railway
+ # Volumes must be added manually

odoo.conf.template:
- gevent_port = 0  # Disable longpolling
+ gevent_port = ${TEMPLATE_GEVENT_PORT}  # Enable evented service (default 8072)
```

### Architecture
```
Internet
   ↓
Railway Proxy (handles WebSocket upgrades)
   ↓
Odoo Container (HTTP 8069 + gevent 8072)
   ↓
PostgreSQL Database (railway)
   ↓
⚠️ /var/lib/odoo (ephemeral - add volume for persistence)
```

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If deployment still fails:
1. Check Railway build logs for new errors
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Check database connection settings

### If WebSocket errors persist:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Verify `gevent_port = 8072` is deployed and the port isn't blocked by firewall

### If files still error:
1. **Without volume**: Expected - files lost on restart
2. **With volume**: Check volume mount path is `/var/lib/odoo`
3. Check Railway logs for permission errors

## ✨ Success Criteria

### Minimum (Current)
✅ Application runs  
✅ Database works  
✅ Login functional  
✅ No critical errors  
⚠️ File uploads temporary  

### Recommended (Add Volume)
✅ All of the above, plus:  
✅ File uploads persist  
✅ Company logos permanent  
✅ Document attachments saved  
✅ Production-ready setup  

---

**Status**: Ready for deployment ✅  
**Action**: Monitor Railway for successful deployment  
**Optional**: Add volume for file persistence
